# Three.js â€“ Basics
Three.js Journey by Bruno Simon [@brunosimon](https://github.com/brunosimon/) is a comprehensive, hands-on course designed to teach 3D web development using Three.js. It covers everything from basic transformations and animations to advanced rendering, shaders, physics, and real-time interactions.

## Lessons Learned
- Transform Objects â€“ Position, rotation, and scaling in 3D space.
- Animations â€“ Using requestAnimationFrame and GSAP for smooth motion.
- Cameras â€“ Exploring perspective vs. orthographic cameras and how to position them for the best viewing experience.
- Fullscreen & Resizing â€“ Ensure the scene is responsive across different screen sizes.
- Geometries â€“ Working with built-in primitives like boxes, spheres, and toruses.
- Debug UI â€“ Adding dat.GUI to tweak values dynamically.
- Textures â€“ Applying images to objects, handling UV mapping, and optimizing textures.
- Materials â€“ Exploring basic, standard, and physically based (PBR) materials for realistic rendering.
- 3D Text â€“ The highlight of my project! Using THREE.TextGeometry creates and customizes 3D typography, adding lighting, shadows, and a smooth interactive feel.
